# MyLinkedList2
This is simple doubly-linked list.
It does not implements most of optional list operations, and permits only Integer values (not including null). I strongly do not recommend using this code in your real projects.

## Usage

```markdown

//Creating Class Instance

MyLinkedList2 thisList = new MyLinkedList2();

```
